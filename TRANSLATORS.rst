* Project Gardares <guardares@gmail.com>

Malay
---------

Translation to the Malay language. This will be translated to both writing
systems used in Malay, namely the Latin-based Rumi script system and the
Arabic-based Jawi script system, to provide compatibility in some areas where
there is still exist Malay people who still cannot read their language in the
newer Rumi script system, or refused to use it. The translation is being made
as general and native as possible to cover the entire region that uses Malay
language, this means native words take precedence over loanwords if and only if
both native and loanwords exist and both are suitable in the context of use.

* Muhammad Nur Hidayat (MNH48) <translation@mnh48.moe>

Turkish
---------

Translation to the Turkish language. Some terms and abbreviations (especially 
those related to coding) are deliberately left untranslated (or the original words
are provided in brackets) to avoid confusion, relying on their common use in 
Turkish language and among Turkish developers.
