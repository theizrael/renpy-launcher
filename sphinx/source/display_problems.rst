Dealing With Display Problems
-----------------------------

On Startup
^^^^^^^^^^

Ren'Py requires that your computer has functioning graphics acceleration
hardware, such as a GPU or a CPU with integrated graphics. Ren'Py will
automatically choose between the following renderers, in order.

These are the classic renderers that were used from Ren'Py 6.13 to Ren'Py
7.4. These may not be available in 7.4 and later games that require
model-based rendering.

1. gl: OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
2. angle: Windows, DirectX 9 or DirectX 11.
3. gles: OpenGL ES 3.0.

These are model-based renderers present in Ren'Py 7.4 and later. These
currently exist to enable new features, and are expected to become the
default renderer in the future.

4. gl2: OpenGL 2.0 or greater.
5. angle2: Windows, DirectX 9 or DirectX 11.
6. gles2: OpenGL ES 3.0.

Older versions of Ren'Py supported a software renderer, but this has
been removed.

A small fraction of systems may experience problems when running
hardware accelerated Ren'Py games.  These problems are often due to
buggy graphics drivers, and so your first step to fixing them should
be to check for an update to your graphics card drivers.

If upgrading your video drivers does not fix the problem, you should
consider switching video renderers, using the following steps.

1. Hold down Shift while starting Ren'Py, or press Shift+G once Ren'Py has started.
2. From the "Graphics Acceleration" menu that appears, choose the renderer to use.
3. Choose "Quit", then restart Ren'Py.

We suggest trying the GL and ANGLE renderers. The GLES renderers may not function
on desktop hardware.


On Suspend/Resume
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have had reports of systems that lose textures when a computer is suspened
and resumed. This is likely a problem with the computer or its device drivers,
but it is possible to force Ren'Py to reload the textures by resizing the
window, or pressing the F key to toggle fullscreen mode.
